# Ford GoBike EDA
## by Alexander Keller


## Dataset

The data was provided through Udacity's course platform and consists of the bikesharing data from February 2019 of the Ford GoBike dataset.


## Summary of Findings

My generally interest was if there is any difference of bikesharing patterns in gender, age, time of the day and whethere or not there are some "hot-spots" where specific advertising prices could be more expensive than somewhere else. This also could be more flexible for different times of the day (like on TV ...)
Therefore I tried to answer the following questions:
- When are most trips taken in terms of time of day or day of the week?
- How long does the average trip take?
- Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or customer?
- Are there a "hot-spots" somewhere?


## Key Insights for Presentation

- the average user is about 35 years young
- the peak time of the day for bikesharing is between 8 am and 10 am as well as 4 pm and 6 pm
- there are significant less bikesharers at the weekend than during the week
- customers ride about two times longer than subscribers
- gender doesn't have a significant effect
